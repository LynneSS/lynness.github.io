Measuring the warp

Need 249 warp threads warped at 7.5 ends/inch.

To warp holding two threads at once, need bouts of 8.


```
8-8-8-8-8-8-8-4 = 60
8-8-8-8-8-8-8-4 = 120
8-8-8-8-8-8-8-4 = 180
8-8-8-8-8-8-8-8 = 248
2               = 250 total
```

## Heddles

1. 7 x 9 + 2 = 65
2. 6 x 9 + 0 = 54
3. 6 x 9 + 2 = 56
4. 7 x 9 + 3 = 66
total = 241 + 8
