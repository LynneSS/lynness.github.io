Towel 1 & 2, draft 6.

Towel 3, draft 2.

Towels 4 & 5, draft 4.

Re-tied on again for towel 6. Removed the last 8 threads so that the left end is white and the right end is blue. That way both weft colors can be carried up the side.

Using draft 2 again. First end was done in white and in pattern.
