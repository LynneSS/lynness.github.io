NAME  Lynne Schneider. I am a spinner, knitter, and new weaver. I like to experiment with patterns and textures.  
EMAIL ADDRESS	leschnei@comcast.net


SAMPLE SELECTED I selected Finnish Twill because I’ve only done the most basic twill, and I wanted to study the effects of changing the treadling sequence while keeping the threading pattern constant. 

TECHNIQUE

PROJECT AND STRUCTURE  Table runner in Finnish Twill with variations in the treadling sequence.

TYPE OF  LOOM USED  Kessenich floor loom

SHAFTS  8

TREADLES  10


MATERIALS

WARP  Cottolin 22/2, 60% cotton/40% linen
	(WARP LENGTH)  499 ends = 2153 yards for 4.4 yard warp
	(WARP COLOR ORDER (IF APPLICABLE TO YOUR PROJECT) all white
	WARP REQUIREMENTS  I used a long warp because I wanted to try out different treadling patterns to determine which ones I liked. I used a floating selvedge.


PATTERN WEFT; TABBY WEFT  Cottolin 22/2, 60% cotton/40% linen in dark teal

	WEFT  REQUIREMENTS  I used approximatel 1738 yards for sampling and the project.


EPI 	24					REED 	12; 2, 2				

PPI 	24

WIDTH IN REED WOVEN 	20.8 in
WIDTH OFF THE LOOM, BEFORE FINISHING	19.25 in

LENGTH FINISHED 	68.5 in

FINISHING TECHNIQUES 	Knots tied in the fringe and the fringe trimmed. Soaked in warm water and laid out to dry.

	SHRINKAGE 	Width 18.25/19.25 in = 5.2%
			Length 62.25/68.5 in = 9.1%

FINISHED MEASUREMENTS 	  18.25 x 19.25 in

ADDITIONAL NOTES 	I tried many treadling sequences with the Finnish Twill threading pattern. It turned out that I only liked 6 of them: the original and 5 others. It turned out that 3 of the patterns are the inverse of the other 3. I didn’t take into account the fact that, even though I wove all of the patterns at 24 ppi, the different patterns would shrink to different lengths.

62 inch length:
7 blocks of pattern
8 blocks of background

Background =
(11 x 4) x 2 = 88
[(12 x 4) + 5] x 6 = 318
88 + 318 = 406 total
406/24 = 16.92 inches

Leaves 45.08 inches for pattern
45.08/7 = 6.44 inches
6.44 inches x 24 picks per inch = 155
But pattern must be an odd multiple of 11
155/11 = 14
13 or 15?
13 x 11 = 143
15 x 11 = 165

Will try 15 repeats.

15 x 11 = 165 x 7 = 1155
88 + 13 = 101 x 6 = 606 + 88 = 694
694 + 1155 = 1849/24 = 77 inches/12 = 6.58 ft

13 x 11 = 143 x 7 = 1001
694 + 1001 = 1695/24 = 70.625/12 = 5.89 ft

Need 19 repeats for first and last section.
