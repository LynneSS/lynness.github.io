Color game blanket:
32 balls of Jaggerspun 2/8 wool yarn, 2 oz/ball = 64 oz.
16 colors X 2 balls/color.

- Fiber content: 100% Wool.
- Knit gauge: 6.5 to 7 on sz 2 to 3.
- Yards/pound: 2240.

- Yardage/unit: 2240 yards / 1 lb cone.
- Wraps/inch: 22 (wpi).
- Weaving tabby sett: 12 to 14.
- Weaving twill sett: 15 to 18.

With 10-dent reed, 2-1-1 will give 13 epi.

1-1-2-1-2-1-1-2-1-2
0-2-2-0-2-2-0-2-2-2
Lt blue 17x2
sett of 14 in a 12-dent reed: 1-1-1-1-1-2-1-1-1-1-1-2 = 14




For each color in the weft (except navy),
45 picks x 48.7 inches/pick = 2191.5 inches x 1 yd/36 inches = 60.875 yards / 2240 yds/lb = .027 lb = .44 oz.
  Each color is repeated twice, so 0.44 oz x 2 = 0.88 oz.

Navy,
26 + (11 x 4) + 45 + (11 x 4) + 26 = 185 picks x 48.7 inches/pick = 250.26 yds / 2240 yds/lb = .1117 lb = 1.7875992 oz.
