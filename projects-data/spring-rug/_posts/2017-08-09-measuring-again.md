![First few stripes of new plan]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/spring-rug/img/dont-like-big.jpg){: .center-image }

Orange fans fabric
7 stripes x 12 picks/stripe = 84 picks
Began with 12.02 oz, after almost 3 stripes (33 picks), 7.12 oz remaining.
(12.02-7.12) oz/35 picks = .14 oz/pick
(84-35) picks x .14 oz/pick = 6.86, very close.

Check the remaining fabrics:
* Purple ovals: 13.08 remaining after 2 stripes. (16.80-13.08) oz/2 stripes X 4 stripes remaining = 12.32 oz needed.
* Purple: 23.24 oz remaining after 2 stripes. OK
* Green vines: 2.58/stripe, 3 stripes remaining. 3 x 2.58 = 7.74 oz needed. OK
