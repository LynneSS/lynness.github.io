![First two stripes of the rug](posts/img/{{ page.folder }}/{{ page.img }}){: .center-image }

The first two stripes are done. Not sure that there will be enough of the orange/green fabric. By the current plan, I need 4 stripes.

* Fabric remaining after one stripe is 6.28 oz.
* 8.72 oz - 6.28 oz = 2.44 oz/stripe * 4 stripes = 9.76. Oops.
