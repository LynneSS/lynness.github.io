## Warp needed
Size of finished rugs: 32.4" wide x 64" long, 2 rugs

### Rug width:

```
33" finished width
+ 2" draw-in
+ 3" shrinkage
= 38" total width on the loom
```

### Warp length:

```
64" x 2 project length
3" x 2 hem
12" x 2 take-up
6" x 2 shrinkage
36" loom waste
= 206" = 5.7 yd => 6 yd
```

6 yd x 249 warp ends = 1494 yd / (1400 yd/lb) = 1.07 lb

```
Warp at 7.5 ends/inch.
