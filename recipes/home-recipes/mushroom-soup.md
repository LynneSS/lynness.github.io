# Mushroom soup
## Ingredients
* 2 to 3 oz dried mushrooms
* Butter, ½ stick
* Fresh thyme or rosemary, 1 sprig
* Yellow onion, large, or 3 or 4 shallots, chopped
* Garlic, 1 Tbsp, minced
* Fresh mushrooms, 1 lb, sliced
*  Salt and pepper
* Sherry or Madeira, ⅓ cup
* Chicken stock, mushroom-soaking liquid or a combination, 5 cups
* Cream, 1 cup (optional)

## Directions
1. Soak the dried mushrooms in 5 cups very hot water until soft, 5–15 min. Remove mushrooms and chop if the pieces are large. Reserve the liquid.
2. Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat. Add the herb, onions and garlic and sauté, stirring occasionally, until soft, about 5 min.
3. Turn the heat to medium high, and add the fresh mushrooms; add the soaked mushrooms when they’re ready. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, and cook until the mushrooms have given off their liquid and begun to brown, about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.
4. Add the sherry or Madeira to the pot and cook, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom as the liquor starts to bubble.
5. Add the stock or soaking liquid and bring to a boil, then lower the heat to a steady simmer and cook, covered, until flavors have melded, about 15 min.
6. Discard the herb. Reduce the heat to low, and purée the liquid with a hand-held mixer to desired consistency.
7. Add the cream and stir to combine. Let simmer for a few minutes. Taste and adjust the seasoning.
