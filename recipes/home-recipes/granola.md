* 1/3 cup maple syrup
* 4 teaspoons vanilla extract
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 cup vegetable oil
* 1/4 cup peanut butter
* 5 cups old-fashioned rolled oats (15.5 oz)

## Directions
1. Heat oven to 325Â° and lightly oil a sheet pan.
2. Combine maple syrup, peanut butter, oil, vanilla, and salt in large bowl and microwave briefly to soften the peanut butter. Whisk together. Fold in oats and almonds until thoroughly coated.
