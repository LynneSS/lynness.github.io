# Pressure Cooker Tomato Sauce Recipe


Yield: Makes about 1 1/2 quarts (1.5L)

## Ingredients
* 2 (28-ounce) cans whole peeled tomatoes (about 1.5kg total)
* 2 tablespoons (30ml) extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for finishing
* 2 tablespoons (30g) unsalted butter
* 4 cloves garlic, minced
* 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
* 1/2 tablespoon dried oregano
* 1 small carrot (110g), cut into large chunks
* 1 small onion (140g), split in half
* 1 large stem fresh basil
* Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
* 2 teaspoons Asian fish sauce, optional
* 1/4 cup (about 10g) minced fresh parsley or basil leaves (or a mix of the two)

## Directions
1. Crush tomatoes by hand and transfer 1 cup to a sealed container (for step 3).
2. Heat olive oil and butter over medium heat in a pressure cooker until butter is melted. Add garlic and cook, stirring, until softened and fragrant but not browned, about 2 minutes. Add pepper flakes and oregano and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add tomatoes, carrot, onion, and basil and stir to combine. Season lightly with salt and pepper. Seal pressure cooker and bring to high pressure. Cook for 45 minutes, then release pressure and open lid.
3. Using tongs, discard onion halves, carrot, and basil. Add reserved tomatoes to sauce and stir to combine. Add fish sauce, if using. Season generously with salt and pepper and stir in minced herbs, along with additional olive oil as desired.
