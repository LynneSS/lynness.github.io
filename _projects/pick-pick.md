## Warping

### Number of warp ends

`5 ends/inch x 30 inches in the reed = 150 ends`

	* Add 4 ends to double the 2 outer pattern warp ends
	* Add 4 for doubled floating selvedges

`150 ends + 4 + 4 = 158 ends total`

### Length of warp
	* Final length = 65 inches x 2 = 130
	* Take-up (10%) = 13 inches
	* Loom allowance = 36 inches

`130 + 14 + 36 = 180 inches total length = 5 yds`

`5 yds x 158 ends = 790 yds total`

* 12/6 cotton seine twine, 500 g / 1,560 yds

`790 yds x 500 g / 1560 yds = 253 g total of warp`

Warping a double length with half as many ends = 79 ends at 6 yd; increase to 80 to fill out a bout of 10.

## Weft
* Flowered
In one piece, 59 in. X 60 in. = 3,540 sq in = 24.58 sq ft. 
	24.58 sq ft/10 oz = **2.46 sq ft/oz**
	* **Main** - 980 g/34.55 oz ––> 2.46 sq ft/oz x 37.9 oz = 93.23 sq ft
	* Border
		* Center - 128 g/4.50 oz = 11.07 sq ft
		* Edge- 35 g/1.25 oz = 3.08 sq ft
		* Mixed - 38 g/1.35 oz = 3.32 sq ft
* White - 1179 g/41.60 oz
* Green - 949 g/33.45 oz
	In one piece, 43 in. x 90 in. = 26.88 sq ft
	26.88 sq ft/16.60 oz = **1.62 sq ft/oz**
	Total = 1.6 * 33.45 = 53.52 sq ft
* Lt. pink - 644 g/22.70 oz
	85 in x 91 in. = 7,735 sq in = 53.72 sq ft
	53.72 sq ft/22.7 oz = **2.37 sq ft /oz** 
* Dk. pink - 479 g/16.90 oz 
	90 in x 62 in = 38.75 sq ft
	38.75 sq ft/16.95 oz = **2.29 sq ft/oz**
* Blue - 144 g/5.10 oz
	360 in. x 1.5 in. = 3.75 sq ft
	3.75 sq ft/1.45 oz = **2.59 sq ft/oz**
	2.6 sq ft/oz x 5.1 oz = 13.26 sq ft

## Weaving

### Hem

* 29 picks = 1/2 inch
* Soumak
* 43 picks = 3/4 inch

### Fabric
![First stripe]({{ page.img-path }}/pick&pick.jpg){: .center-image }

4*5.5+5*3.3+6*1.1+2*5.5+2*3.3 = 62.7 + cream rows & hem

* Green, 39 g
* Flowered, 48 g = 1 5/8 inches (1.625) = 9.5 rows
	1. 5.5 in x 9.5 rows/1.625 in = 32 rows = 162.5 g
	For the whole rug, need 4 x 162.5 g = 650 g
	2. After 207 g more, 3.5 inches = 19 rows
	For one section, (207+48)/3.5*5.5 = 401 g
	For the whole rug, 4*401 = 1604 g
	3. 208 more = 5.5 inches total
	For the whole section, 48+207+208=463
	For the whole rug, 4*463=1852
* Dk pink, 10 g
* Lt pink, 208 g
* Cream, 37 g

1074 – 831 = 243

### Progress

* First flowered stripe
145 g/5.5 in = 26.4 g/in
Need 4*145g=580 g

![First stripe]({{ page.img-path }}/pick-pick-stripe.jpg){: .center-image }

5.5 in flowered and 30 stripes.

* First green stripe
Not sure this is the right green.

![First stripe]({{ page.img-path }}/pick-pick-green1.jpg){: .center-image }

![First stripe]({{ page.img-path }}/pick-pick-green2.jpg){: .center-image }

~38 inches for twill pick. 38x12 = 456 inches needed/12 = 38 ft

![First stripe]({{ page.img-path }}/pick-pick-new-green.jpg){: .center-image }

3.3 in green = 26 picks

* First pink stripe
7 light pink picks  
12 dark pink and 11 light pink, pick& pick - only 3.3, should have been 5.5
7 light pink picks

![First stripe]({{ page.img-path }}/pick-pick-pink.jpg){: .center-image }

## New plan
Outside pink regions decreased to 3.3 with 1.1 on each side. Middle pink regions increased to 5.5 with 1.1 on each side.


![First stripe]({{ page.img-path }}/pick-pick-new-plan.jpg){: .center-image }

* 1.1 pink = 7 picksv 
* 5.5 pink = 36 picks

Dark pink - 479g and 
12x2 + 7x2 + 18x2 = 74 picks
After 55 picks, 196 remaining. 479-196 = 283 g used/55 picks = ~5 g/pick.
5(7+12) = 95 g needed
